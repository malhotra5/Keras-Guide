# Keras-Guide
A simple to advanced Keras tutorial. 
## Getting Started and Requirements  
Requirements include basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks. A good machine learning course is available for free on Coursera done by Andrew Ng, a great teacher who worked at Stanford. Additionally, a good computer, Python 3 and some installations. This guide's focus is on intermediate to advanced learners. 
### Prerequisites
