# Keras-Guide
A simple to advanced Keras tutorial. 
## Getting Started and Requirements  
Requirements include basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks. A good machine learning course is available for free on Coursera done by Andrew Ng, a great teacher who worked at Stanford. Additionally, a good computer, Python 3 and some installations. This guide's focus is on intermediate to advanced learners. 
### Prerequisites
* Numpy (support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
* Tensorflow (a symbolic math library)
* Keras (neural network library)

### Installation 
Install using pip - 
    pip install "moduleName"
## Note
The code for this repo will be written using the IDLE editor and Jupyter Notebooks. People who havn't used Jupyter Notebooks often find it hard to understand it's structure and design. Therefore, I can efficiently teach this material to many people without additional learning requirements. 
## Topic We Will Cover
* Numpy
* Neural Networks
* Keras
## Table of Contents 
* Numpy, Matrices as Arrays 
* Nueral Networks Recap
