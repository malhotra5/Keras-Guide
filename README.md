# Keras-Guide
A simple to advanced Keras tutorial. 
## Getting Started and Requirements  
Requirements include basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks. A good machine learning course is available for free on Coursera done by Andrew Ng, a great teacher that worked at Stanford. This guide also applies to advanced learners. Otherwise, a good computer, Python 3 and some installations.
### Prerequisites
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Keras

### Installation 

    pip install "moduleName"

## Topic We Will Cover

## Table of Contents 
* Numpy, Matrices as Arrays 
* Nueral Networks Recap
* Keras Sequentail, Quick Start to efficient Deep Learning
